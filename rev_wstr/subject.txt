Reverse string by whitespace. This one was the first new problem for me.
 I had to write a program that takes a string delineated by white space and prints 
 the string with the words reversed. ./rev_wstr "This is a test" would output "test a is This". 
 I ended up doing this one recursively, printing each last word, 
 then setting the last space to null and calling the function again. Conceptually interesting, and nontrivial to implement.

Examples:

$>go run . "This is a test"
"test a is This"
$>go run . "My horse is Amazing."
Amazing is horse My
$>go run . | cat -e
